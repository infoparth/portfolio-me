                  Ah, curious, are we? üëÄ  
Alright, here‚Äôs the full story ‚Äî since you asked.

I‚Äôm Parth Verma, a full-stack developer who builds across both Web2 and Web3 ‚Äî from crisp React frontends to Solidity smart contracts and Go/Rust-powered systems. Whether it‚Äôs startups, side-projects, or hackathons, I love turning ideas into things that actually work (and scale).

It all kicked off in my first year when I cracked Flipkart Grid 4.0 Round 1 ‚Äî that‚Äôs where I first got my hands dirty with blockchain and full-stack dev. Not long after, I found myself at the Solana Hacker House, surrounded by builders, shipping my first real projects. That moment turned interest into obsession.

Since then, I‚Äôve worked with early-stage startups like BuildnBoost, Legitt, and Kanine Klans, where I‚Äôve taken ownership of full product pipelines ‚Äî writing frontends in React/Next.js, APIs in Node.js and Express, and contracts in Solidity, Rust, and more. My toolkit includes TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Hardhat, Foundry, Ethers.js, Viem, Tailwind, and whatever else the build needs.

I‚Äôve also thrived in the hackathon circuit ‚Äî I won a pool prize at ETHIndia, and placed first runner-up at a fully Web3 hackathon, building DeFi systems with real impact in intense 36-hour sprints. I live for that chaotic, collaborative energy where everyone&apos;s just trying to build something awesome.

What I‚Äôve learned is that I‚Äôm someone who takes initiative, adapts quickly, and keeps shipping. I don‚Äôt wait for perfect conditions ‚Äî I just get started. Whether it‚Äôs shaping product direction, writing code, or debugging at 3AM, I love being part of the messy middle that leads to something real.

So yeah ‚Äî that‚Äôs me.  
Builder. Hacker. Early-stage startup guy. Just out here trying to build the future, one commit at a time.
